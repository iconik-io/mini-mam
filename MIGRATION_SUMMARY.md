# Migration to src/ Directory Structure

## Overview
Successfully migrated all source code from the root directory into a `src/` directory for better project organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
- **Before**: All services were in the root directory
- **After**: All services are now in `src/` directory

```
Before:
├── api-gateway/
├── assets-service/
├── files-service/
├── transcode-service/
├── search-service/
└── shared/

After:
├── src/
│   ├── api-gateway/
│   ├── assets-service/
│   ├── files-service/
│   ├── transcode-service/
│   ├── search-service/
│   └── shared/
```

### 2. Updated Files

#### Configuration Files
- `start.py` - Updated service paths to include `src/`
- `docker-compose.yml` - No changes needed (uses Docker build context)
- `Makefile` - Updated log file paths to include `src/`

#### Docker Files
- `docker/api-gateway.Dockerfile` - Updated COPY paths
- `docker/assets-service.Dockerfile` - Updated COPY paths
- `docker/files-service.Dockerfile` - Updated COPY paths
- `docker/transcode-service.Dockerfile` - Updated COPY paths
- `docker/search-service.Dockerfile` - Updated COPY paths

#### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated project structure documentation
- Updated startup instructions to reflect new paths

### 3. New Files Created
- `src/__init__.py` - Makes src a proper Python package
- `verify_structure.py` - Verification script for the new structure

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between source code and configuration
2. **Standard Practice**: Follows common Python project conventions
3. **Scalability**: Easier to add new services or modules
4. **Cleaner Root**: Root directory contains only configuration and documentation

## Verification

The migration has been verified using the `verify_structure.py` script:

```bash
python3 verify_structure.py
```

All structure checks pass, confirming the migration was successful.

## Usage After Migration

### Starting Services
```bash
# Using the startup script (recommended)
python start.py

# Or individual services
python src/api-gateway/app.py
python src/assets-service/app.py
python src/files-service/app.py
python src/transcode-service/app.py
python src/search-service/app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# No changes needed - Docker builds work the same
docker-compose up
```

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Start development environment
make start

# Verify structure
make verify

# Run tests
make test
```

## Import Paths

The Python import paths have been updated to work with the new structure:

- Services can still import from `shared` modules
- The startup script adds `src/` to the Python path
- Docker containers maintain the same internal structure

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality remains the same
- API endpoints unchanged
- Docker deployment process unchanged
- Only the internal file organization has changed

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `make install`
2. Verify structure: `make verify`
3. Start services: `make start`
4. Test functionality: `make test`

The migration is complete and the framework is ready for use with the new structure!
